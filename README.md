# FoodWizard
Full stack recipe discovery application created as platform to implement CRUD operations with SQL database hosted on Google Cloud

The application uses a react.js frontend with a node.js backend that communicates to a mySql database hosted on Google Cloud Platform.

The app allows users to navigate recipes based on input criteria such as cost, ingredients, calories, etc. Users may also create accounts to favorite and rate recipes. Other data provided by the application includes store and restaurants where certains ingredients or dishes are available.

Possible Improvements:
1. Add geolocation data and real-world data for restaurants and recipes.
2. Increase recipes count
3. UI changes to make access and user-interaction more seamless.
